# Dashin

Personal dashboard app that collates important task lists and other information that 
i personally would like to keep on top of and summarise at a glance.  This may also include
calculations.  This may also in the future include: a front end, REST to allow 
the front end to query only the information it requires at the time and also date/time based 
rules to allow the most important things to be displayed
